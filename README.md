Game Description

A six-sided die is rolled once every turn. The game will track how many of each number have been rolled, like how many 1s, 2s, etc. Once one specific number has been rolled 5 times, then that number is the winner, and the game is over. The user can then start the game over, and they can also reset the game at any point.

To Play:
This is a very simple game made with jQuery, so npm install and open the index.html file to play.
